## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trang Tu [she/her]

I'm a Master's student at Northeastern University. 

I spent 8 years in Seoul, South Korea, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Life Science and Biotechnology. After gaining three years of industry experience, I decided to move to the U.S. to further my studies, deepen my expertise, and become skilled with computational tools.

Bioinformatics is burgeoning and interwoven with biotechnologies in disease diagnosis. 
I have a keen interest in applying algorithms to drug discovery and bridging the gap between biological knowledge and computational tools. 
With extensive experience in wet labs and a solid foundation in programming with R and Python, I can easily comprehend wet-lab data, review literature effectively, and communicate my findings. 
I have a strong interest in cancer biology, particularly in oncology treatment.

I will be graduating with a Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics from Northeastern University in August 2025. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about traveling, exploring new cuisines, and capturing lifeâ€™s little moments through photography. 
Whether itâ€™s the textures of a local dish or the unique details in everyday scenes, I love immersing myself in the experience and preserving it through photos.
